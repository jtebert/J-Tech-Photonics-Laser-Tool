# J Tech Photonics Laser Tool

This is the new official home for the JTP laser cutting Inskape extension.


## Installation

The Beta 2.0 release isn't out yet, however you can cloan or download this branch to develop or test out new features and bugfixes.

Unzip the files directly into the Inkscape user extensions folder. Inkscape lists the location of your extensions folder under **Edit** > **Preferences** > **System**.

Restart Inkscape and you're done.


## Documentation

More documentation coming sooner or (more likely) later. In the meantime you can refer to [JTP's official website](https://jtechphotonics.com/?page_id=2012).


## For developers

Pull requests are welcome both for bug fixes and new features. Just make sure to test your code with Inkscape 1.0 and Python >=3.6. This branch will no longer support older Python or Inkscape versions.
